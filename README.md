# Group 25 Project

Group 25 R for Bio Data Science project. From the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) the GEO dataset [GSE239956](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE239956), "RNA sequencing of Tau overexpressing human SH-SY5Y cell line revels that Tau protein is able to alter global gene expression and chromatin structure" was used as data for this project.

## Raw Data Retrieval

For the the raw data retrieval, since we are using a GEO dataset, the [GEOquery](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GEOquery.html) package from Bioconductor was used. No local download is necessary.
